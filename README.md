### This is a simple python Telegram bot  to get some information from your Solaredge installation.
The documentation about Solaredge's API can be found [here](https://knowledge-center.solaredge.com/sites/kc/files/se_monitoring_api.pdf).

I have creted a [markdown version](./API-doc/Summary.md) to make it easier to read.
